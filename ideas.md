Philosophy:

Write everything from scratch as much as possible

Labs WIP:

C:

1. Basic binary, bitshifting, hex, bitwise ops
2. Stack vs. Heap, processes, pointers, structs, functions, headers
3. Queue structure, double pointers
4. Advanced binary data, data I/O to file, struct packing

C++:

5. C++, Classes (and structs, again) "employee" class, OOP
6. Templates, STL, smart pointers, handy tools for making C++ like python
7. Threading
8. Pre Practice: (somehow make use of everything)
9. maybe another general C++ practice project?

Real Deal:

10. Something that involves equations, numerical stuff?
11. WAV I/O
12. Image I/O
13. Real time shit
14. ???
